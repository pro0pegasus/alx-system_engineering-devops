Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

On July 15, 2023, a disruption in our web stack led to an outage in the user authentication service, lasting from 15:30 to 17:45 UTC. The impact was significant, with 75% of users experiencing login failures during this period. The root cause of this incident was traced back to a misconfiguration in the load balancer, preventing proper routing of authentication requests.

The issue was first detected at 15:30 UTC when our monitoring system reported a sudden spike in error rates. Initially, we explored database performance issues as a potential cause. However, by 15:45 UTC, this assumption was discarded, and we shifted focus to investigate a potential DDoS attack, initiating traffic analysis.

Recognizing the severity of the situation, we escalated the incident to the DevOps team at 16:00 UTC. It wasn't until 16:15 UTC that we uncovered the actual root causeâ€”a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. The load balancer was not properly routing authentication requests to the designated service, causing the widespread login failures.

To address the issue promptly, a temporary fix was implemented at 17:00 UTC by correcting the load balancer configuration. A more comprehensive resolution was achieved by 17:45 UTC through a thorough update of the load balancer configuration.

In analyzing this incident, several improvements have been identified to enhance our system's reliability. Moving forward, we plan to strengthen our monitoring capabilities to promptly detect load balancer misconfigurations. Additionally, automated testing for load balancer configurations during deployment will be implemented to catch potential issues before they impact user services.

To execute these improvements, specific tasks have been outlined. A comprehensive review of load balancer settings will be conducted to ensure accuracy and reliability. Automated testing procedures for load balancer configurations will be integrated into our deployment pipeline. Furthermore, monitoring systems will be enhanced to trigger alerts for specific misconfigurations, providing a proactive approach to potential issues.

This outage has served as a valuable learning experience for our team. The swift detection and resolution of the load balancer misconfiguration minimized the impact on our users. By implementing these corrective measures, we aim to fortify our web stack against similar incidents and maintain a resilient infrastructure for uninterrupted user experiences.
